Alcove is an automatic backup system for Unix machines.

## System Administrators

Alcove is designed for expert system administrators, so there are no compromises on functionality for the sake of simplicity. Nevertheless, the system is fairly intuitive.

You can find official releases of Alcove [here](https://github.com/bioneos/alcove/releases).

Check out the [system administrator guide](./docs/administrator-guide.md) for instructions on how to set up Alcove.

## Developers

Alcove was originally an internal project at [Bio::Neos](https://bioneos.com). It started as a Bash script written by [@rossj](https://github.com/rossj) when he was a high school intern. It was then ported to Ruby with a Sinatra monitoring system by [@malyon](https://github.com/malyon).

Since then, the project has been rewritten in Node.js with an Express monitoring system. Bio::Neos interns including [@osandvold302](https://github.com/osandvold302) and [@dominicrutk](https://github.com/dominicrutk) have worked to develop its functionality and adjust to Node.js conventions.

Now, Alcove is an open-source project so that others can use it or contribute to it. To contribute to Alcove, read through the [developer guide](./docs/developer-guide.md).
